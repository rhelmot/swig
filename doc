A symbol is a set of layers

A layer is a set of frames
    some frames are keyframes
    only keyframes are defined with frame() objects
    there is a list of which frames are keyframes for optimization
    and an index to which keyframe is currently being used

A frame has a source (an image, a drawing, or another symbol) and instructions for how to draw it.
    drawing options include:
        -relative coordinates of drawing anchor
        -x and y coordinates of anchor on screen
        -x and y scaling
        -rotation
        -x and y skew
        
    And for symbols:
        -Starting frame
        -Single Frame, Play Once, or Loop (0, 1, 2)
